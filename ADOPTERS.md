* [Getup](https://getup.io) - Getup is the original author of CEL Playground, we use the playground with our customers to help them learn how to make use of CEL within Kubernetes
* [Mario Valente] - Cel Playground helps me a lot in my CEL expression studies and is a valuable partner when it comes to important implementations in quick tests and immediate feedback, in addition to being able to simulate real scenarios. I love this tool.
