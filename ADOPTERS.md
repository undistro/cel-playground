## Adopters list (alphabetical)

* [CEL](https://cel.dev) - CEL team refers users to the CEL Playground by Undistro when community members ask for help getting started. This has proven to be a valuable support tool and an important tool in helping people learn how to wield the language.
* [Getup](https://getup.io) - Getup is the original author of CEL Playground, we use the playground with our customers to help them learn how to make use of CEL within Kubernetes
* [Ifood](https://www.ifood.com.br/) - Cel Playground helps me a lot in my CEL expression studies and is a valuable partner when it comes to important implementations in quick tests and immediate feedback, in addition to being able to simulate real scenarios. I love this tool.
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy) - CEL Playground is referenced within Kubernetes Validating Admission Policy to help users familiarize themselves with CEL before they try using it in their deployment.
* [Kubescape CEL Library](https://github.com/kubescape/cel-admission-library) - Kubescape project has a CEL-based validating admission policy library. This library implements the widely used Kubescape controls in CEL so users can use them as Kubernetes admission policies. Contributors are using CEL Playground to test and develop the controls in this library and it is a great tool to save time since we do not need to develop our own tooling.
* [LINUXtips](https://linuxtips.io) - LINUXtips effectively utilizes CEL Playground to support students in grasping the implementation of security policies using CEL. This valuable resource enables students to actively test and apply what they are learning in a practical way, helping them gain a deeper understanding of real-world applications.
* [Red Hat OpenShift] (https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) - Our API review team uses CEL Playground to demonstrate how various expressions function and direct developers at it for them to do the same. It's a good vehicle for communicating how particular techniques work.
* [Weni](https://weni.ai/) - The CEL Playground has been instrumental in refining our skills in CEL expressions. It’s a powerful, user-friendly tool, making it a valuable resource for anyone working with CEL.
